# ALX-Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repo contains programs written for the C low-level programming course @ALX-Africa SE. In these projects, which  occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
## More will be added as the program progresses
